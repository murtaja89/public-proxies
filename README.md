### HTTP Proxies

HTTP proxies are commonly used for web browsing. They work by routing your web traffic through a server, allowing you to access sites while hiding your IP address.

### SOCKS5 Proxies

SOCKS5 proxies offer more flexibility than HTTP proxies. They can handle any type of traffic, including HTTP, FTP, and more. This makes them ideal for applications that require a variety of protocols.
